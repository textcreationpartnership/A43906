            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Since my writting that Book, I chanced to meet with an old Book entitled, The Hiſtory of Prince <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> and upon reading ſome part of it, <hi>I</hi> found it to be not only The Hiſtory of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> but alſo of The Seven Wiſe Maſters of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine all thoſe Stories that are in the former Book of
<pb facs="tcp:62164:3"/> the ſeven Wiſe Maſters; I compared them one with an other and ſaw that though the ſeveral Stories were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, yet my <hi>French</hi> book was much the better, being larger and conteining more variety of Stories then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one which was not only very ſhort in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance but alſo ſo old in the language that it was hardly good ſence: <hi>I</hi> therefore thought it might be worth my while to Tranſlate and print this <hi>French</hi> book; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> fell to work and have now perfected it to my great coſt and trouble, my coſt hath been extraordinary in the Pictures, for I have beſtowed more on this book then are in any book of this bigneſs in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may read every particular of all the Hiſtories in Picture; and indeed Picture is not only convenient, but neceſſary in all Hiſtories of this nature there is ſo great affinity between them, that Picture is ſaid to be Dumb or ſilent Hiſtory &amp; Hiſtory to be ſpeaking Picture there being a Poetical Art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Soldier having worn out his patience with atten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dance, went to the old womans who had been his broak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this intended Merchandize; and tells her of his fruitleſs attendance ſhe wonders at it and preſently goes back with him to the houſe, where having a Key ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Gate, and leaving the Soldier in an outer Court went towards the houſe where ſhe ſaw the young Lady in the Pond in the manner her husband had left her. After ſome ſmall Dialogue, whereby they both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how the State of their affairs ſtood; the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy having ſtill a mind to enjoy her Gallant, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that the old one ſhould unſtrip and ſtand in her stead, whileſt ſhe went to her Lover. The young woman being dreſſed in the Old womans cloathes went to the Soldier, who at firſt took her to be the <hi>Matron,</hi> but by her ſpeech finding it to be otherwiſe, he ſoon enjoyed thoſe pleaſures they had ſo long deſired.</p>
            <p>The old Gentleman who was gone to bed could not ſleep for thinking of that nights adventure, and believing that he was not ſufficiently revenged on his wife he reſolves on a further, and leaving his bed goes down to the place where he left his wife, and utters outragious ſpeeches againſt her, which the old woman who was there, thought was beſt not to anſwer but to remain ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; at which he was ſo, enraged that having a Knife in one hand he took her by the noſe and cut it off, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at her face, and wiſhing her to preſent it to her Lover, he returns to bed. Soon after the Lady having taken leave of her young man, returnes to the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; who although almost dead with her wound gives her an account of her misfortune ſhe hears this Story with admiration, eſteeming her ſelf doubly happy in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enjoyed her friends love, and eſcaped her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bnads fury: and now ſhe comforts the old woman by
<pb facs="tcp:62164:5"/> promiſcing her a great reward. This pacified her, and the young woman believing that the worſt was past &amp; that better was to come, unty'd the old one, and again took her place in the water, where having contriv'd how to mannage her matter ſo as to come off with honour; ſhe thus plaid her trick. Believing that her husband was within hearing as indeed he was, She with a Low voice makes a heavy complaint againſt him that had ſo w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This was the ſum of her complaint &amp; prayer, &amp; then continuing for ſome time ſilent ſhe at length brake forth into lowd exclaimations of joy &amp; thankſgiving to the heavenly powers for her reſtoration, calling to her husband to come and ſee the token of her innocence: <hi>He</hi> being amazed at this diſcourſe was reſolved to try the truth, &amp; riſeing out of his bed lighted a candle, went down and comes to his wife, and beholding her face finds it whole and ſound: whereat ſtanding amazed he began to deteſt his raſhneſs and fear heavens vengeance and deprecating the wickedneſs of his impious fury; he looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his moſt chaſt wife and brings her again to her bed, ſhe by this means recovering both her noſe &amp; the affection of her husband.

               <p>ONE Thouſand and forty years after the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> a wiſe and powerful Prince, reigned in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62164:7"/> that Superb and Tryumphant City, he being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a very fair and virtuous Princeſs: had by her a Son who was ſo well proportioned, and of ſo exquiſite beauty, that every one concluded him to be more Divine than Humain; in ſuch manner that the affection which all the world had for the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities and graces of this young Prince, cauſed that the name of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> was given to him, which is as much as to ſay amiable, and although he was but yet in his very infancy, yet in that tender age, every one concluded that in time this young Prince would arrive to very great perfection, and would not be in any thing inferiour to the other Emperours his Predeceſſors; and moreover there was not any Mathematician, Aſtrologer, Diviner, Phyſiognomiſt nor Chyromancer, who did not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one reſpectively finde by his Art, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the influences of the Caeleſtial Planets, this Child ſhould be of an admirable Spirit; very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in all Sciences, and accompliſhed in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of virtue, wherein the Emperor took ſo great content as the Majeſty of his degree, and the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of ſuch a Father did require; purpoſing on his part not to fruſtrate ſo good a Nature, but to uſe his endeavour to render his Son, ſuch as the opinion of the world had conceived of him. And for aſmuch as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Illuſtrious blood, good Conſtellations, nor large Eſtates, are not of themſelves ſufficient to render a man great, if Nature be not helped and aſſiſted by Sciences and Vertues; therefore ſo ſoon as this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Eraſtus</hi> was of an Age fit for to learn, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour provided himſelf of the moſt knowing men that he could find, whereby he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62164:7"/> under whoſe tuition he ſo well profited, that at the age of ten years he began to have a taſte of the ſecrets of Phyloſophy; and the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour very well knowing that the Wiſdome and Prudence of the Son, does ordinarily redound to the glory of the Father, and therefore reſolving to render his Son perfect in Phyloſophy, he (from amongſt all the Wiſe Men of his Empire) made choice of ſeven Phyloſophers, of whoſe skill and knowledge he had ſufficient experience, that he might confidently commit the charge of ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who in time might ſucceed to the Government of the great Roman Empire The Emperour having thus delivered his Son to their charge, commanded them to inſtruct him with the greateſt dexterity, as well in Vertue and good Manners, as in Letters, and all ſorts of Sciences, that all the world might know of what a Father this young Prince was Son: and by what admirable Maſters he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, promiſing to theſe Phyloſophers very great recompences, beſides the Honour they would acquire of all the World, by the good doctrine wherein they would inſtruct the Prince,</p>
               <p>Theſe Philoſophers having with merry hearts taken this charge, by reaſon of the Divine Spirit which they knew to be in the young <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> which gave them hopes that they ſhould attain to great honour in the execution thereof; and that they might the better execute it, they made choice of a place without the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was very well ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62164:8"/> very pleaſant walks, enriched with fair Fountains, the playn was very conſiderable, for the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Springs and Rivers, which running through it, at laſt met in a little lake, which was furniſhed withall ſorts of fiſhes: there might you ſee all ſorts of trees, as well Fruit-trees as others, and all the Fields enameled with Flowers according to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; all accompanied with a World of Birds, who by their various Notes, rendred a continual Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both night and day. In this pleaſant place was a Pallace built for the Prince <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that he might be at ſome diſtance from the noiſe of the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> where he ſo plyed his ſtudy, that you could hardly diſtinguiſh whoſe affection was greateſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He was excellent in all the ſeven liberal Arts: for, firſt he was a good Grammarian, by that means learning to ſpeak properly and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. By Logick he found out reaſons to diſcern a falſe propoſition from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62164:8"/> as for Muſick he could by his voice, make an entire and perfect Harmony; In fine he learned by Aſtrology, not only the courſe of the Stars, but alſo their influences, which foretel things to come: furthermore he had the knowledg of all things requiſite to the perfection of man, in ſuch manner that in ten years wherein he was under the tuition of the ſeven Phyloſophers, he was not only a good Schollar, but ſurpaſſed in knowledg thoſe Maſters that had inſtructed him. Finally there did ſhine in him all the good graces as well of Body, as of mind, for he abhorred all Vices, and on the contrary, exerciſed all ſorts of Vertue, paſſing his time in Diſputations with his Maſters: in which he took very much delight. About this time it was that the Empreſs his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the departed this life; and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of it, although he had as tender a love for her, as any Child could have for a Mother; yet nevertheleſs knowing that Death is a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing, and common to all; and that all the Lamentations in the World will not reſtore life to thoſe that are Dead, he ſpent but few ſighs and tears upon her, but concluded with the Poet in this manner,</p>

The Slave being raviſhed with the great continence of Prince <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and much more with his wiſe diſcourſe, knew not what to ſay, and leſs what to do, for to carry back the preſents he durſt not, fearing he ſhould highly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62164:13"/> offend the Empreſs his Miſtreſs, and how to cauſe the Prince <hi>Eraſtus</hi> to accept of them, he knew not, but on the contrary he found he had no opportunity to diſcover the principal point for which he was ſent: ſo that not being able to ſpeak one word, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as in a maze. But the ſeven Phyloſophers came to him in good time, who having underſtood as well of the Prince <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> as of the Slave, all that had paſſed between them, having firſt commended the Conſtancy and Magnaminity of their Schollar, for refuſing things ſo delectable to the eye, as being repugnant to their Phyloſophical ſeverity, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs perſwaded him to accept the preſents which the ſlave ſaid were ſent as well from the Emperour as the Empreſs, that he might not anger or diſpleaſe either, and this he at laſt though unwillngly aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. The Slave being thus diſpatched, entered into new conſiderations what he ſhould do with the Empreſs, for to let her know the buſineſs in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner as it had paſſed, he feared would put her out of her wits, and that he ſhould be accounted an ignorant fellow, and knew not how to perform the charge that had been given him, and of which at the beginning he had given ſo good hopes: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the leſs ſeeing himſelf fruſtrate of all means to accompliſh his deſires, he foreſaw that inſtead of great rewards which he hoped for (if the matters ſhould take effect) there was danger that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs might doe him ſome miſcheif, and having a great while conſidered what he had beſt to do, he in the end reſolved to keep his Miſtreſs in good hopes to get what he could from her, and keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her favour. And now being come to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62164:13"/> her preſence, he with a ſmileing countenance made his obeyſance, and told her quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what had paſſed between him and the Prince <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> aſſuring her that the Prince had received her preſent with very great affection, and and for a greater expreſſion of love, had very amorouſly kiſſed every particular peice that had been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; had expreſly charged him to give the Empreſs a thouſand thanks, and on his behalf to entreat her not to diſplace him from her heart until his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> which he would haſten as much as poſſible, and by all means to accompliſh. The poor Princeſs giving credit to the Slave, and believing the loue of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> to be greater towards her, than the Slave had reported, having a good opinion of her beauty, did ſo enflame the fire which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Kindled in her heart, that out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of love, without regarding her degree and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſhe gave great preſents to the Slave, to let him know how great an eſteem ſhe had for him, in regard of the pains he had taken in his late nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, making him great and magnificent promiſes, if he ſhould manage her affairs ſo as ſhe might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to her deſired wiſhes: and although the Slave had loſt all hopes of performing any, thing by reaſon of the great continance which he ſaw in the Prince <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> yet nevertheleſs that he might gain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what on the Empreſs, he nouriſhed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Empreſs <hi>Aphrodiſia</hi> writ a Love Letter to Prince <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> which he having read, tore in peices with anger, threatning the Slave to chaſtiſe him, if ever he again attempted to appear before him about any ſuch affair. The Slave keeps the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in hopes, telling her the contrary to what had paſſed.</head>
               <p>SUpper time being come, and the Empreſs being ſeated at the Table with the Emperour, ſhe was more melancholly then ordinary, and took no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the paſtime that was preſented to her: but ſighed ſo vehemently, that the Emperour took notice of it, and being troubled, asked her the cauſe of her ſighing, to which ſhe anſwered; that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a horrible dream which had hapned about break of day, was the cauſe of her preſent ſadneſs: and indeed ſhe ſaid true, for it was <hi>Eraſtus</hi> whom ſhe had ſeen in this Viſion, although ſhe had told it to be a horrible Serpent; the Emperour then being willing to put this Fancy out of her mind, told her that ſhe muſt give no credit to Dreams, being things without ſubſtance, that vaniſh away, whereupon ſhe put on a mercy countenance, and entertained the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour as ſhe was wont, until it was bed time, which occaſioned more pain to this poor Princeſs, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for his part went to ſleep, but the Empreſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62164:16"/> could not cloſe her eyes for thinking of her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Eraſtus</hi> being of opinion that her affairs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſo proſperous a beginning, ſhe ſhould loſe noe time or occaſion to bring it to that end ſo much deſired by her: and ruminating all the night on what means ſhe ſhould uſe to perfect her deſires: ſometimes ſhe doubted that the Slave was inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for an enterpriſe of ſo high a conſequence; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſhe could not find any way poſſible to ſpeak with <hi>Erastus,</hi> becauſe he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with grave Phyloſophers; whoſe doctrine ſhe very well knew was contrary to her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. In concluſion ſhe reſolved to ſpeak to him by Letters and Preſents, and ſo ſoon as the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appear, that night in the opinion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs being longer than uſual, ſhe aroſe, and being retired alone into her Cabinet, ſhe writ this Letter which followeth.</p>

However if your temper cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds to your name (for <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſignifies amiable) <hi>I</hi> hold my ſelf aſſured, that my recommendation ſhall be received, which nevertheleſs <hi>I</hi> preſent to you with all poſſible affection; and becauſe <hi>I</hi> wondred at your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at my Wedding with the Emperour.

               <p>Some time ſince, there lived a Gentleman in <hi>Rome</hi> having but one Son, who bring deſirous to have him well bred up as his only dear Child, cauſed him to be nurſed in the houſe, and laid in his Chamber; the ſome Gentleman had a Dog which he had a very great eſteem for, as well for his handſomeneſs as good properties, and he took much pleaſure in him, as it was poſſible for any Gentleman to take in ſuch a creature. It happened that there was a Tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or running at Tilt, held in the publique Place in <hi>Rome;</hi> to which the Gentleman amongſt others of his quality reſorted: And no ſooner was he gone but his wife alſo being as unadviſed as many other woman, had a mind to go ſee the pleaſures of this Tournement, and thereupon ſhe went with all her Chamber-maids and damſells; and to their great misfortune the Nurſe went to the Top of the houſe, from whence although ſhe could not ſee, yet ſhe might hear what was done at the Tilting, having only ſhut the Dog into the Chamber, where her Maſters Son lay: This Gentlemans houſe being old and out of repair, there were many breeches in it even in the very room, where the Child and Dog were and that one of theſe holes, there at this time entered a great and horrible Serpent, which the dog
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62164:32"/> ſeeing, and that he made towards the Cradle, for the natural love which theſe Creatures bear to their Maſters, even to hazard their lives in their defence; he ſlew upon the Serpent, to keep him from hurting the Child: But the one was not more furious in aſſaulting, then the other was in defending, and the Dog and Serpent ſtrugling together nere the Cradle where the Child lay they over turned it; ſo that the Child fell to the ground, but without any harm, for the clothes that were upon were by the tumbling now underneath, and the Cradle ſtanding on the four pomells, the Child lay as ſafe and as well as it had done before it was overturned: the Dog being enraged as well at the wounds he had received of the Serpent, as at the wrong which he ſaw was done to his young Maſter, threw himſelf with great fury upon the Serpent, who knew well enough how to defend himſelf; however in the end, the dog re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained victorious and tore the Serpent in the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner he could imagin, ſo that he was all ſmeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his blood.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Nurſe coming into the Chamber to ſee how the Child did, ſhe had no ſooner put her foot within the door, but ſeeing the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle topſie turvy, and the Dog all bloody, with out looking any further, and being very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he who had ſaved the Childs life, had killed him; ſhe began to tear her Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, and with outragious cryes went to entry this ſad news to the Childs Mother; who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the death of her Child, fell into ſuch a paſſion as any one would for do the loſs of ſuch a Child, and if the Nurſe expreſſed her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62164:33"/> ſorrow in tearing her cloaths, it is to be ſuppoſed that the poor Mother did not forbear doing the ſame to her fleſh; not only ſhe her ſelf, but all the women of the houſe who had accompanyed their Miſtreſs, encreaſed the lamentation, and made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible noyſe with their great cryes and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not any of them having the wit to go into the Chamber, and ſee how it had hapned: but there they continued their out-cryes until the Gentle-man returned from the Tourney, to whom they all with tears related, not that which they had ſeen, but that which they had imagined by the Nurſes diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The poor Father hearing theſe ſad tidings, more full of rage than tears, (for anger and ſadneſs which are great paſſions had ſtopped his tears) went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into the Chamber, where meeting the Dog and ſeeing him all bloody, gave abſolute credit to what the woman had told him: and having his ſword drawn in his hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62164:33"/> Dog, came by reaſon of the combate which he had with the Serpent, in defence of the Child; which the Gentleman ſeeing, and being enraged that he had in anger kill'd his good Dog, he would have ſlain his Wife, and all the other Women of the houſe, who had been the cauſe of the Dogs death. Ah poor Dog ſaid he, that thy friend-ſhip and loyalty have been ſo unfortunate to thee, to cauſe thy death inſtead of a recompence which thou didſt deſerve for ſo well defending my little Child. In fine, this poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could not be appeaſed for the loſs which he had cauſed of ſo faithful an annimal as his Dog was, ſo that every one that hard it, had pitty and grief for the Childs loſs, was now converted into grief for the loſs of the Dog; all which ſorrow hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this Gentle-man, for having given too much credit to his Wife, for if he had been wiſe, he would firſt have examined the matter, and accordingly have judged it, without entring into ſuch fury, as to act a thing which cauſed perpetual ſorrow to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remedy. I ſhall conclude that this will be your caſe, if you give credit to the words of a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple woman, to put your Son to a Shameful death, whoſe cauſe being heard deſerves rather praiſe than puniſhment and perpetual infamy; and therefore as your Majeſties moſt humble ſervant, I adviſe you that laying aſide all anger before you proceed further, you cauſe this action of your ſon to be conſulted on, by wiſe &amp; experienc'd men, ſuch as wil be faithful to you, &amp; that you will revoke this ſentence, which your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath cauſed you to pronounce. The Emperour took ſuch notice of the Philoſophers ſaying, that he commanded ſtay of the execution of the ſentence,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62164:34"/> until he ſhould take further order therein; and thus was Prince <hi>Eraſtus</hi> defended the firſt day.</p>

It is true, I reſent it more than you laying our honour more to heart than
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62164:34"/> you, who however ought to ſhew it more exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: as yeſterday you made me believe you did, but I know not who hath ſo ſuddenly cauſed you to revoke your ſentence, and I doubt to my great trouble, if you do not take more heed to your affairs, that it will happen to you, as it did to a very fair Pine-tree, which inſtead of being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was cut up and deſtroyed. What Pine was this ſaid the Emperour, and what happned about it, to which the Empreſs anſwered. A while agoe there was a Gentleman of <hi>Italy,</hi> who had a very fair Garden, wherein he took ſo much pleaſure, that he therein planted all ſorts of Herbs, and Trees, and among others he had a very fair Pine, ſo fair and ſo ſtrait as any could be in the World, ſo that this Gentle-man eſteemed this Pine more than all the Trees in the Garden, and thereupon he there made an arbour, taking great pleaſure to remain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nder the ſhaddow of it for the moſt part of the day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had a mind to read, or otherwiſe to paſs the time. It hapned as one often ſees among other Trees, that from the root of this Pine, ſprung a ſucker, which the Gentle-man ſeeing, being very much pleaſed at it, he commanded his Gardner to look carefully after it, hoping by this means to get an other Pine as fair as the former, and this young ſucker finding the freſh Earth that was put about it, grew very well at the beginning, but being grown up ſo high that the branches of the firſt Pine kept the Sun from it: it did not grow ſo well as at the firſt, but became bent and crooked. The Gentle-man being troubled at it, asked the Gardner the cauſe, who anſwered, that the bowes of the great one,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62164:35"/> gave ſo great a ſhaddow, that the young one not having the Sun and air to make it grow ſtrait up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Nature, it therefore was crooked and did not thrive, whereupon the Gentle-man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to lop the old one, and take away the branches which hindered the Sun from the young one, ſo the old one was lop'd all away on one ſide. It hapned that this Gentle-man had a voyage to make for ſome moneths; but before he went, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his young Pine to the Gardner above all things, in this the Gardner did not fail, ſo that the Sun coming to the young one, it grew again as it had formerly done, but however it ſtill continued crooked; on the contrary, the great one began to wither on the ſide it had been lopped. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at his return, ſeeing the great Pine half dead, and knowing that theſe two Pines hindred one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that there was little hopes of the great Pine, in regard it was ſo decayed, cauſed it to be cut up, and thus was this Tree (that had formerly been ſo well beloved) deſtroyed for the young Pines ſake; which although it grew to be a great one, yet it ſtill kept it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I hope that Judgment, and juſtice will ſhew you the great fault you want againſt them both; and I doubt it will happen to you as it did to a wild Boar, who was deſtroyed by flattery, which is a very good example and which I would relate to you, if I did not think it loſs of time, whereupon the Emperour ſaid; my dear, I have directly promiſed, and ſworn to ſtop for this day, the execution of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and I may not in point of honour break my word and Oath: But I aſſure you that if ſome more important cauſe do not happen, I ſhall to morrow morning let you know that revenge which <hi>I</hi> know to be reaſonable, is as pleaſing to me as to your ſelf; and therefore I deſire you to let me know the ſtory of the wild boar whereof you have ſpoken; for on one ſide, you will much pleaſe me, and on the other ſide, you will it may be make me more reſolved then I was. Then the Empreſs began her diſcourſe ſaid.</p>
               <p>There was ſome time ſince in a great and ſpacious forreſt a large Wild boar who had no other feeding then the wild fruits which grew naturally without the help of mans art and yet however were very good, as well by reaſon of the fertility of the ground, as for the good temperature of the Climate, where they grew, among other trees there was a great wild pear-tree, whoſe fruit did very much pleaſe this wild boar; and therefore he came ordinarily thither, and ſhaking the tree with his ſhoulders, to make the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62164:41"/> fruit fall; having filled his belly, he would be gone to his Den. It happened that a Herdſ-man, that kept a herd of cattle at the entrance of the forreſt, loſt one of the beſt of them and believing that it was ſtrayed into the forreſt, as indeed it was, conſidering the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in finding it, be was troubled, but hoped to light upon it, he went to ſearch in the forreſt, but it was loſt labour, &amp; having ſpent ſome dayes in the forreſt, &amp; ſeeing that it was to no purpoſe; he intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but in his way he came to this great pear-tree which I have ſpoken of; and ſeeing very fair peares, and being ſomewhat an hungry, he began to beat them down with his ſtaff; he had no ſooner taſted of them, but finding them better than he expected, he th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sir, <hi>I</hi> hope you will pleaſe to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62164:44"/> remember the great deſires which you had for a long time, to have iſſue whereby to perpetrate the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of your blood: Whereupon Nature was ſo favourable to you, that in ſhort time you were provided of a Son, the moſt accompliſhed that ever lived he hath bin inſtructed in all things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for an Emperour; wherein he hath ſo well profited, that you may truly eſteem your ſelf to be the happieſt father, that hath for along time lived; which felicity will turn to your prejudice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual regret; if you ſuffer your ſelf, in an affair of ſo high importance, to be over ruled by the Counſell of one ſimple woman; for although women have the uſe of reaſon, as well as we; yet nevertheleſs by reaſon of their imbecility, they ſuffer themſelves to be ſo tranſported, by their affections; that very often they lay a ſide their reaſon, and are given over to their paſſions; this was not unknown to a certain Old Knight, who like you, had took a young wife, and if you had followed his example; your affairs had not been in ſo bad condition, as now they are. And what was it this Knight did ſaid the Emperour?

But ſince it is done, he ought to appeaſe his anger, the Gentleman ſeeing that all the ſorrow in the world would not reſtore his bitch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, was ſomewhat pecifyed, only ſaying to his Wife, that ſhe had done very ill in that manner to kill his bitch for ſo ſmall a fault; this being over the Gentle-man and his Friends, ſpent their time in their ordinary divertiſements, and the young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was pleaſed at her heart, finding that ſhe had ſo bravely come off from her undertaking, without any difficulty: and therefore the next morning early ſhe went in all haſte to her mother, to let her know of this laſt paſſage, preſſing her to put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution that which ſhe had promiſed, ſeeing ſhe had ſuch certain proof of her Husbands patience: the Mother underſtanding how matters went, made as if ſhe were very glad, and told her Daughter that truly ſhe had reaſon to keep her word with her, but that ſhe might have greater aſſurance, and ſome cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer proof of his heart, ſhe deſired one tryal more of his patience, promiſing and ſwearing to her daughter, that if her Husband then continued in that temper, ſhe would immediately, and without any delay, give her the content ſhe deſired. And what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof would you have ſaid the Daughter, I think what we have already is very ſufficient: but for ought I ſee, all your diſcourſes tend only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the content, which you have promiſed to give

Daughter ſaid the Mother, do not take it ill, for what I do is not to deny you my aſſiſtance, but to accommadate your honour, and my own alſo; the firſt tryal that you made was upon a Plant, and therefore you proceeded to a ſecond, upon a beaſt: now I would have you make a third proof upon men, what is it you mean ſaid the Daughter, that I ſhould kill ſome body, it is ſomewhat difficult for a woman to do, but if there be no other way to attain my deſires, I ſhall not queſtion but to perform it; God forbid anſwered the Mother, for I do not intend any ſuch matter, but this is my meaning, that as you have already offended your Husband, ſo now in the laſt tryal; the diſpleaſure you ſhall do him, ſhall not only extend to him, but alſo to the Company; and this muſt be done in ſomewhat of as great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as was that of the Lawrel, or Bitch which you killed; and <hi>I</hi> have thought how, and what it ſhall be.

The Gentleman being very diſcreet, took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62164:52"/> of it at preſent, that he might not diſturb the Company, but cauſed the Table to be taken up, and other ſervice brought, for there was plentiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of all ſorts of victuals, and thus was the day paſſed away without thinking of any thing but paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, wherefore the young woman had a world of joy in her heart, beleiving now that there was no obſtacle that could hinder her content, ſo that ſhe only waited the good hour when every one would be gone, that ſhe might go to her Mother, and give her order for that which ſhe ſo ardently deſired; but the Gueſts kept company together all the day with the Gentleman, that ſhe being forced to continue with them, by neceſſity deferr'd going to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the next morning, not queſtioning but then all things would fall out to her expectation. But ſhe ſound it otherwiſe, for although the Gentleman had paſſed away all his birth day, that he might not trouble his gueſts, without takeing notice of the ſhame which his wife had cauſed him: yet however he had not forgotten it, nor the other two outrages which ſhe had done formerly; and therefore being a wiſe man, he purpoſed to chaſtiſe his wife, without making any noiſe, and therefore the next morning finding her awake, and that ſhe went to dreſs her ſelf, to go to her Mother, he commanded that ſhe ſhould not riſe, whereupon the good wife being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, replyed, that ſhe had a minde to riſe, having ſlept enough already; but the Gentleman anſwered her, that the reaſon why he would have her lye in bed, was for her good, and that it was convenient for her to do ſo: that ſhe might take a medicine that he would give her, for what cauſe ſaid ſhe, for I

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62164:56"/> a King of <hi>England</hi> who deſireing that the affairs of his Kingdom ſhould be well managed, and being unwilling to take pains himſelf, that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the more pleaſure, he therefore committed the management thereof to ſeven great Perſonages, who belonged to his Court, and who having the repute of the Sages, pretended to have knowledg in all things; whereupon in ſhort time it was brought to this paſs, that the King only minding his pleaſure, left all diſpatches and affairs to theſe ſeven Sages who acted all things as they were minded, and gave the King what account they beſt thought for their purpoſe, but above all thing; they took care not to diſpleaſe him, ſo that in time they were in ſuch high eſteem, and they were taken rather to be Lords of all <hi>England</hi> then Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; true it is, that in the beginning they took ſo good order in the execution of juſtice, that all things were done in good order: but afterwards when they had taſted of the great gifts and preſents that was uſually made them; they then were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to heap up riches, that they minded nothing elſe, without reſpecting their honour, or the zeal they ſhould have to juſtice; and among other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to raiſe mony, they found out one than would raiſe them a world of riches, at that time it was a cuſtome in <hi>England,</hi> for the Natives to give ſuch credit to dreames, that the believed the greateſt part of their affairs and chiefly thoſe of importance were divinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them in viſions and dreams which they little or much underſtood according to

As the old Gentleman was about to reprove her further; the moon went down, &amp; now was the night obſcured with a darkneſs, more then uſuall, ſhe being glad of this advantage, ſhe thus ſpake; that I may dye like a Chriſtian, before I drown my ſelf, I will make my laſt Will and Teſtament, and firſt I bequeath my Soul to Heaven, and my body to the Earth, but all other things what ever, I ſolely leave to my dear husband, for him to diſpoſe of, as he ſhall think convenient; having finiſhed her ſaying ſhe went to the well, and there finding a great ſtone, ſhe took it up in her arms and lifting it up cryed out, now <hi>I</hi> drown my ſelf, and to threw the ſtone into the well, having thus done ſhe ſtept to the ſide of the door again, and there abſconded her ſelf.

                  <p>There was a wealthy Burgeſs living in a certain City, who kept a Pye, the Bird he lov'd ſo well, that he ſuffered none to feed him but himſelf, and as he fed him taught him ſeveral Languages; this Pye was ſo apprehenſive and grateful to his kind Maſter, that whatſoever he ſaw done in the houſe he told his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>This Burgeſs was married to a young wife, who was much more beautiful than honeſt, requiting her husbands love and affection with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now the Pye as ſhe told her Maſter every thing, ſhe obſerved, upon his return ſo particularly this junketting wantonneſs, and was ſo open mouth'd, as the report hereof did ſpread it ſelf through the whole City, her Husband hereupon much troubled and grieved, upbraided her with diſloyaly and charged her down right with adultry, to which ſhe ſaid ſhe was innocent, and that he was to blame to belive his Pye, and that as long as he continued ſo doing, there would be nothing but variance and diſcord among them; but he reply'd the Pye could not lye, for what ſhe ſaw or heard, that ſhe told him, and therefore
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62164:107"/> would belive her rather than his Wife.</p>
                  <p>It ſo hapned not long after that, this Burgeſs tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled abroad, and was no ſooner gone, but ſhe ſent to adviſe her friend, that to avoid the ſuſpition of the People he ſhould come ſecretly to her that night, to do as he was accuſtomed: being come, as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the houſe, he ſaid Deareſt I fear this Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bait Pye will diſcover us, but ſhe bid him be bold, for it was dark, and therefore the Pye could not ſee them; the Pye hearing this, ſaid 'tis true, I ſee you not, but I can hear you, and know that you Cuckold my Maſter, which It ſhall tell him when he cometh home; at which this luſty young fellow was ſtartled, but ſhe bade him be of good courage, and ſhe would be revenged of the Pye, ſo they went and lay together, about midnight the Adultreſs aroſe, and calling her maid-ſervant, commanded her to fetch a Ladder, which they did ſet up to the roof of the houſe, and having got thereto, they made a hole therein, ſtraight over the Pye, and through it caſt at the Pye, ſomtimes water, then ſmall ſtones, ſand and the like, in ſo much that the poor Pye was ready to dye.</p>

The wife hearing this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62164:107"/> ſaid to her husband, you have hitherto belived in the Pye, <hi>I</hi> will ſee whether you will continue ſo doing. She ſaith ſhe had like to have lyed with rain, hail and ſnow, that night ſhe accuſeth me of adultery, where as there was never any thing clearer but my innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, there having not been ſeen ſo lovely fair a night as that for many years, and therefore for the future belive her not. The good man to be ſatisfied of the truth, inquired of the Neighbours whether that night was foul or fair, who all affirmed no night cuold be fairer; then going to his wife he acknowledg'd the fault of his credulity, and after that went to his Pye, and having rail'd at him for ſowing diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and wife, notwithſtanding he had lov'd him ſo well, and though the Pye proteſted he had told him nothing but what he either ſaw or heard, yet he wrung his neck of, the Wife at the ſight here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was over-joy'd, but the Husband looking up, ſaw a ladder, and a hole in the roof the houſe, and a veſſel of water, ſand and ſtones ſtanding by, which made him ſoon perceive the treachery of his Wife, at which he grew ſo troubled to be thus deluded, and deprive his dearly beloved Pye of life, that he ſold all that he had, and went a Pilgrimage. Now ſaid the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher to the Emperour, was not this a falſe and wicked woman, by deceit and craft to cauſe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pye to be ſlain, and the Emperour anſwered it was very true, and I much pitty the Pye, that ſhe ſhould dye for her fidelity, this is a good example for me, therefore this day my Son ſhall not dye, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher commending the prudence of the Emperour, took his leave, having firſt recommended him to the protection of the Almighty.</p>

               <p>At theſe words the Emperour could not forbear weeping, which the Empreſs obſerving, ſhe proſecuted her diſcourſe with greater affection than before, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was not ſo much troubled on her one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as in reſpect of him, ading that ſhe very welknow that all theſe delayes about <hi>Eraſtus</hi> proceeded from the malignity of the Philoſophers, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeal and religion endeavoured to ruin the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and life of the Empreſs; and I wiſh to God, ſaid ſhe, that it hapneth not to you as it did to a King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who having to do with the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> was in bad caſe, by being adviſed by his Philoſophers as you are by theſe here; and although I find my ſelf very much weakned by the continual trouble which affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As to this, the contents of the Letter being conſidered, the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very plain, and in ſhort is her Husbands age, for there is nothing more diſpleaſant to a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man than to lye by an old mans ſide; ſo that if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do not take them away as ſoon as they have a minde to it, they never leave then to ſtudy ſome way how to diſpateh them, and I wiſh to God that their caſe would alwayes prove as it did with a Damſel of <hi>Modena,</hi> whoſe ſtory I ſhall willingly relate, which may ſerve as well to this purpoſe as another, if I did not doubt to diſpleaſe the Counſel with my tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no, no replyed the Emperour, proceed and you ſhall very much pleaſe me, for time cannot be better imployed than in hearing thoſe things, from whence

               <p>The poor Gentleman having remained ſeveral dayes in this condition, his wicked wife failed not to let him taſte often of her powder, ſometimes ſhe gave it him in Broth, and other times after ſome other manner, that ſhe might continue him in his Feaver, but finding that this cauſed him only to languiſh and not diſpatch him as ſhe intended (for the reſtaurative which the Phiſitian adminiſtrd to him was of ſuch vertue, that it exceeded the malignity of the Feaver, and maintained his radical temper) wherefore ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make uſe of abſolute poyſon, to effect that which neither Age nor his diſtemper could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and ſo as it might be ſuppoſed that his Feaver only did occaſion his death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon having purchaſed ſome ſtrong Poyſon, She mixed it with ſome Broth which ſhe gave

But fortune was at that inſtant ſo favourable to the old man, that taking the Porringer with trembling hands, he chanced to let it fall, and it became a Medecine to the Cat, which ſoon lick'd it up; the woman was very angry at this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident (pretending her diſpleaſure to be at the loſs of ſo precious a reſtaurative) and having thus ſpent all her Poyſon, for reſolving to make fair work ſhe had given him as much poyſon as would have killed a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen: Wherefore that being loſt, ſhe was neceſſitated to give him of the true reſtaurative, by vertue of which the good Gentleman recovered his former health, the powder which the old ſhe Devil had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided being likewiſe all ſpent. Whereupon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woman was mad with anger, and therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved whatever might happen to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

His wife per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that, to expreſs her kindneſs to her husband, ſhe undreſſed him for bed where ſhe purpoſed he ſhould take his laſt ſleep, and having pulled off his Clothes ſhe very gently laid him on his Bed: In the mean time her Paramour being ſent for, he attended her in an adjoyning Chamber, where they were uſed to meet together. She ſoon left her husband aſleep to go to her waking friend, in whoſe company ſhe took her pleaſure, and having enflamed him to a height, ſhe fell upon the diſcourſe of the long life of her husband, and underſtanding that her young Lover was as much troubled as her ſelf, ſhe told him that if he had courage enough to do one thing which

He making this proteſtation to his Miſtreſs, ſhe made him ſwear to performe it; after which ſhe tooke him by the hand and led him into the Chamber, where the good man was in a found ſleep, and being approached near the Bed, ſhe put a naked Dagger into his hand ſaying: Behold him who hath ſo long hindred the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of our deſires, he is faſt aſleep, and will be ſo for theſe four hours, for ſo eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This antient Gentleman had bred up a Dog which always attended him: This dog followed the Litter wherein the woman was carried to the Country-houſe, ſuppoſing that his Maſter was alſo with her.

The good Dog ſeeing his Maſters body, began to lick it ſo that he cleanſed it from the blood wherewith it was beſmeared, and yet for all that none knew the body; the news hereof being carried through <hi>Modena,</hi> cauſed that many and ſome of the Chief of the Citty went to ſee it, among the reſt ſeveral of the Murthered Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The wretched Woman who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Modena,</hi> hearing the noiſe about the Dogs and the body that was found, was about to flee, but the Officers came timely enough to ſeize on her and ſecure her and her wicked Chamber-maid; ſhe ſeeing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62164:124"/> her ſelf taken and bound, and knowing in whoſe cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhe was, freely confeſſed the fact, ſaying ſhe very well knew the cauſe why ſhe was taken, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly related how ſhe had uſed her deceaſed Husband that ſhe might be rid of him, and how ſhe had kill'd him with her own hands, whereupon ſhe was led to the Governour, where ſhe reiterated and confirmed her diſpoſition, further adding that ſhe repented ſhe had endured ſo much, and that ſhe had delayed his death ſo long, and that if it were to do again ſhe would do it.</p>
               <p>The Governour hearing this, being much troubled to ſee ſo fair a young woman ſo obſtinate in her wickedneſs, which ſhe did not endeavour to excuſe, but rather to juſtifie, he therefore condemned her to be burnt alive, at the common place of Execution in <hi>Modena,</hi> and that her Chambermaid who had not only kept her counſel, but bin her aſſiſtant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion ſhould alſo ſuffer with and accompany her in death, and this ſentence was the next day executed, this wretched woman not ſhewing the leaſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſo wicked a crime.</p>
               <p>And this may be the very caſe of the Queen of <hi>Germany,</hi> for I am very confident, that no cauſe hath induced her thus miſerably to calumniate the King her Husband, but only an earneſt deſire to have him diſpatched out of her ſight.

               <p>The night walkers who had the Bacon, went to the Tavern and drank ſo long there that all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would not pay their reckoning; wherfore they bethought themſelves of ſelling their Bacon, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drank their Land-lord to a handſome Pitch, they told him that they had a bargain for him, he asked what? and they replyed Bacon, this is good chaffer ſaid he, if I could ſee it, whereupon one of them went to the place where they had left their Bacon, and ſoon after returned, and ſetting down his load they opened the Sack, but inſtead of Bacon the Lawyers head appeared.

               <p>The noiſe of this accident was ſoon ſpread through all the Citty, and came to the eares of our Lawyers Chamberfellow, who knowing ſomewhat of the truth of the matter, went to the Juſtices to hear what would be ſaid of the Whole; but there was little proof of any thing, till he declared that he knew his Companion the dead Lawyer, went the foregoing evening to the houſe of the murdreſs whom I may now truly call ſo; ſhe being ſuppoſed to be guilty therefore ſhe and her husband were both committed to Jayle, and being ſeperated and put into ſeveral Priſons and ſtrictly examined; it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe confeſſed the whole fact, and alſo accuſed her husband for murthering the afore mentioned three Knights, ſo that juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>King <hi>Philarchus</hi> hearing this, began to conſider, yet being ſtill fearful of hazarding his rich <hi>Columne,</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:62164:144"/> but withal very deſirous to have the treaſure which he certainly believed was underneath; wherefore he deſired the Philoſopher to make a caſe for the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne,</hi> as ſoon as poſſibly he could, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the other Engines to ſupport it according to his beſt skill ſaying that as he found the Engines to be ſtrong, he would conſider whether he would have any digging under the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne</hi> or not. The Philoſopher who deſired no more, being very glad that they had brought the King to this point, in very cheerful manner told him, ſo Sir be confident of this, that the Engin which we ſhal make, ſhall be ſo ſtrong that they ſhall be not only capable of ſuſtaining the miraculous <hi>Columne,</hi> but ſufficient to ſupport a Tower, ſo that all the digging that ſhall be uſed under it, ſhall not move it, but it ſhall remain as firm as if fixt on a ſure foundation; and thereupon they made an Engine of wood to be as a caſe to the <hi>Columne,</hi> ſo that nothing could harm or touch it, this being done as the Pyoneers wrought, theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers were very curious that the <hi>Columne</hi> ſhould ſuffer no prejudice by duſt, and the better to preſerve it, they covered that and the four Animals which ſerved as ſupporters with cloathes, and they fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the void places between the Caſe and the <hi>Columne</hi> with Wool; but theſe Traitors pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately mixed Pitch and Tarre, not permitting any to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:62164:144"/> whereupon the King was well pleaſed and contented, and commanded that without any delay they ſhould proceed to digging; then the Pyoneers began, but although they d gged all day, yet they found nothing, nay, they cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon his promiſe the King retired, very deſirous to ſee this great treaſure diſcovered, certainly believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Philoſophers having made proviſion of all things neceſſary for the finiſhing their treaſon, and being aſſured of a Friggat, they went about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when all the world were aſleep, to the place where the <hi>Columne</hi> ſtood, and having anointed and bedaubed the caſe and wooden Engine, and all the Materials about the <hi>Columne</hi> with Oyl, Greaſe, and other ingredients fit to take fire, they put a barrel of Pitch, Sulpher and other Materials juſt underneath the <hi>Columne,</hi> and having ſet fire to it, on a ſuddain it made a terrible execution,</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers ſeeing this, and finding all things to be as they deſired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the <hi>Columne</hi> could not poſſibly eſcape being deſtroyed, and knowing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62164:145"/> they had no more to do at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> they embarqued themſelves in their Friggat, where they had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately conveyed not only their Gold and Silver, but alſo ſeveral rich things which they had of the Kings; which they eaſily procured, as having liberty to take any thing they had a mind to without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for ſo the King had commanded, and the Mariners plyed their Oars ſo luſtily, that by the next morning they had loſt the ſight of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in which there was a great uproar; for theſe Traitors had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo much wood about the <hi>Columne,</hi> under pretence of ſecuring it, that it cauſed ſo great a fire, that it not only conſumed the <hi>Columne</hi> which was their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal deſign; but alſo the Arch of Marble under which the <hi>Columne</hi> was placed, at the fall of which there was ſo great a noiſe as if the whole Pallace of King <hi>Philarchus</hi> had fallen into ruin; at the noiſe of which all the People did run to ſee what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo did the King too: who now too late ſaw his Covetuouſneſs, but however he commanded ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things to be done: to ſee if the <hi>Colum</hi> might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but all his endeavours were ineffectual, for not only the Arch but the <hi>Colum</hi> were both wholy ruined.</p>
               <p>The people perceiving this, many of them ran with violence to the lodging of the Philoſophers, and there they underſtood that they were gone, and had carried much of the Kings treaſure with them; and then their ſuſpition was cleered that all this ruin came by the only treaſon of the Philoſophers; who being arrived at <hi>Cyprus</hi> were welcomed by King <hi>Nichoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who gave them much treaſure in recompence of their good ſervice, whereby they had empoured him to be revenged on King <hi>Philarchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the poor <hi>Rhodians</hi> were very
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62164:145"/> much troubled, that they were deprived of that which ſerved for a defence, not only to the Citty of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but to all the Iſland; and it was not long before their ſorrow was increaſed, by means of King <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomachus,</hi> who having privatly raiſed great Forces, and obtained the alliance and friendſhip of divers Princes of <hi>Natolia,</hi> who were troubled at the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Rhodians</hi> their Neighbours; fell upon the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> being unprovided, and ſo well proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their intentions, that they took the Citty, and King <hi>Philarchus</hi> had hardly the liberty to avoid the fury of the war, who from being a powerful Prince, was reduced to the neceſſity to turn Schoolmaſter, &amp; teach publickly in the Iſle of <hi>Metolin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus as the unextinguiſhable fire which was of ſo great commodity t the poor <hi>Rhodians,</hi> was put out by the ſottiſhneſs of a Schollar, ſo the Citty of <hi>Rhodes</hi> was taken and pillaged by the cunning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of the Philoſophers, and the King of that Iſland forced to confine himſelf as a baniſhed man, into an Iſland, there to ſpend the remainder of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life.</p>

The King very readily performed this, but he was no ſooner come out of his doors, but the Crowes came fluttering and Croaking more then ever they had done. The young <hi>Entichus</hi> ſaid to the King, know Sir, that this Croaking and fluttering of the birds, comes not by any evil that is in you nor any other in your houſe, but theſe birds come to you to decide a difference which is between them: This Crow which is known by his feathers to be older than the other, took to wife this other which appears to be a Male but is a Female, but when a ſcarcity of proviſion happened, he hunted her away and would not keep her company, ſo that ſhe joyned her ſelf to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62164:188"/> this young Crow, which is that in the middle; when there was victuals enough to eat then the old Crow would again have his Female, but ſhe ſeemed to be diſcontented, and furtherfore the young Crow hoped to have ſome pleaſure with the Female in that good ſeaſon, ſince he had provided for her in the time of ſcarcity, &amp; this being in debate, &amp; they not agreeing there upon are com to you that by your royal authori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty whereby you make Laws and ordinances, that you would be pleaſed to put an end to their difference, by your definitive ſentence; aſſuring you Sir, that ſo ſoon as you ſhall pronounce ſentence they will be gone, and trouble you no further. The King hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what <hi>Entichus</hi> had ſaid, adjudged by his abſolute ſentence the Female to the young Crow, and he had no ſooner made an end of pronouncing his ſentence but the Crowes flew away without ever returning again, to the wonder of all the Spectators, who much marvailed thereat, but above all the King was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, and being tranſported ran to embrace young <hi>Entichus;</hi> telling him that from thenceforth he ſhould take him and no other for his natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſaid he I will perform my promiſe in giving you my Daughter and the half of my Kingdom, <hi>Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> making his due reverence to the King, humbly thanked him, and ſo they returned to the Pallace, the good old <hi>Sterifo</hi> being joyful of his Adopted Sons advancement after he had given him his beſt inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and bleſſing, departed goeing home to his wife and leaving his Son <hi>Entichus</hi> at Court, both beloved and admired at by the King and all his Nobility, as well in reſpect of his Gallant deportment, as of his

To this Prince <hi>Entichus</hi> replied, Moſt renowned King and honoured Father, I moſt humbly thank you for your great reſpect towards me, in condeſending to give me attendance, and other equipage befitting your Son, but I deſire you to ſpare that charge and trouble, for if my own vertues are not ſufficient to to beſpeak and make known my quallity, it will be in vain to have any other Ornaments; therefore <hi>I</hi> deſire to go, although not altogether unaccompanied

               <p>Prince <hi>Entichus</hi> having finiſhed his ſpeech, which was dilligently obſerved by the King who knew it was modeſt and reaſonable, he therefore conſented thereto and gave him leave to depart accordingly firſt furniſhing him with a ſufficient quantity of Money and Jewels; and now in ſhort time he arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Court of the Emperour, who received him with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:62164:196"/> blood of two Children of the Emperours which the Emperour muſt with his own hands kill, and after bath him with their blood; This was the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy preſcribed for his malady, wherefore he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſilent accounting it unreaſonable to kill two Innocents to preſerve one Sinner; but let him reſolve what he pleaſes, it was the pleaſure of heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve otherwiſe and as he had given an Unparalleld proof of his friendſhip to the Emperour, ſo the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour muſt retalliate and indeed exceed it in this great tryal of his naturall affection in preferring his friend before himſelf, for his Children may be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf being the beſt part of him; wherefore that I may proceed you are to know that the Emperour ſtill continued his prayers to heaven, neither was heaven ſilent, but in a viſion told him that his friend <hi>Entichus</hi> knew how to be cured, he thereupon goes to him and deſires him to tell him and that truly if he did not know of a remedy for his diſeaſe, to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much importunity, <hi>Entichus</hi> not only told him that he did but alſo the manner now, but withall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him from executing it; to this the Emperour replyed, that ſince heaven preſcribed the remedy he would diſpute no further but obey what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and thereupon went and Cut the throats of the two Innocents, and ſaving the blood and bathing his friends body therewith, he became as cleer and fair as ever, to the great joy of them both, the Emperour rejoycing that he had ſo good an opportunity as to give proof of his friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The King being thus healed, it was thus agreed that he ſhould leave the Court and go ſome few miles out of the Town, wherein he ſhould have attendants
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62164:197"/> ſuitable to his quality, and then he ſhould ſend word of his approach, and ſo ſhould be met and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to his dignity appertained; accordinly there came a Meſſenger the next day into the Emperors Hall, who gave the Emperor an account of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of his friend King <hi>Entichus.</hi> The Empreſs hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this news was joyful, and told the Emperor that by all means they muſt entertain their good friend very ſplendedly, and to that end ſaid ſhe, you with your Nobles, and I with my Ladies will go meet him; to this the Emperor agreed, and they rode together till they met him and received him with great reverence; and attending him till they came to the Pallace, where they gave him royal entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Although the Emperor was joyful at his dear friends company, yet the Empreſs exceeded him in demonſtration of her joye; which the Emperor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, he told her that he was well pleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: wherefore ſaid the Empreſs ſhould I not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my joy to the heighth, for his company is more precious than all the Treaſure in the World; for by his means you attained to this hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Emperor hearing this, deſired her to take good notice of what he ſhould preſently ſay; it is not long ſince (continued he) that a deformed Leaper was in my Court, I well remember him ſaid the Empreſs, a moſt horrible creature he was indeed; ſuppoſe (ſaid the Emperor) this Leaper were our friend King <hi>Entichus,</hi> and that there was no way to cure him of his loathſome Leaproſie, but by the death of both your children, in whoſe blood he muſt be

It is a very ſtrange queſtion replyed the Empreſs, but I thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, that had I ten Children, I would kill them all with my own hands, rather than our dear friend King <hi>Entichus</hi> ſhould continue ſo loathſome a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for we might have more Children, but never ſuch a friend as he. The Emperour hearing her conſtant ſpeech, was reſolved to make full tryal of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and told her how all had hapned, and that her two Children were dead, ſhe bearing this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all her eouragious ſpeeches, yet Nature ſo wrought with her that ſhe ſunk down in a ſwoun, but remedies being uſed ſhe recovered; at the newes of the Emperours Childrens death, the Nurſes went to ſee after them, when they came where they were, and expected to finde them dead, they ſaw the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for they were alive and ſinging, and about their Necks where they were cut, were Circles of Gold; this joyful newes was brought to the Emperor and Empreſs, who were exceeding joyful thereat, give-thanks to Heaven for this Miracle.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Emperour raiſeing an Army, went along with King <hi>Entichus</hi> to <hi>Candy,</hi> and overcoming an Army which the Queen and her Husband had raiſed, King <hi>Entichus</hi> was ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now the King being a ſingle man, that theſe two friends might be allyed by marriage as well as affection, the Emperour having one only Siſter, gave her in Marriage to his Friend King <hi>Entichus</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:62164:198"/> and then theſe two great friends were again ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>The Emperour returning to his Empire, and the King remaining in peaceable and quiet poſſeſſion of his Kingdom; and now he began to think of his old friends eſpecially his Foſter father <hi>Sterifo</hi> whom he ennobled with Titles of honour, and giving him an honourable and profitable employment at Court, had him near him as a Counſellor in all his affairs; and carrying himſelf courteouſly and juſtly to his Subjects, he was beloved of all them and feared of his enemies.

The Merchant obſerving what the King had ſaid, began to take notice of all thoſe that were in the Hall; and on the other ſide every one looked upon him, believing that they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſomewhat that was as yet unknown, and after he had well looked upon and taken notice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, he ſaid to the K ng that he could not find that his Son was there preſent, whereupon the King ſaid, if you had well conſidered the Spectacle which you had of the two white Birds, and the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that was made to you, you would of your ſelf have known that which I ſhall now tell you; for it was I my felf, whoſe way to greatneſs you would hinder inſtead of advanceing it as you ought.

But the King who was no leſs generous then great and puiſſant took hold of him and raiſed him, praying him that forgetting what was paſſed he would make uſe of that power which God had given him and that he would reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that he had made him know by effects that it is impoſſible to interrupt or hinder that which the pleaſure of God hath once ordained; and ſo having

               <p>By this Example (ſaid <hi>Erastus</hi>) and many others as admirable as this, which I could relate; we may aſſuredly conclude that whatſoever hath been once ordained and eſtabliſhed above, doth uſually come to paſs, ſo that nothing here below can obſtruct or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; being aſſured of this, I and my Maſters did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to very great hazard and danger, in our coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the only remedy that we had was for me to be ſilent for the ſpace of ſeven days, in doing whereof the heavens promiſed me a good iſſue and deliverance, provided that ſome would defend my cauſe, for that Term; the which my ſeven Maſters like prudent and valliant Champions have done: I therefore reſolved to follow the right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which had been preſcribed me, for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my life and honour, the which otherwiſe I ſhould have diſhonourably loſt (as the heavens had let me know) ſoon after my arrivall at <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſhame whereof would have been much more grievious to me, than the death wherewith I was threatned.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> The Empreſs <hi>Aphrodicia</hi> underſtanding the deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her condition, being in Priſon deſperately killed her ſelf.</head>
               <p>SO ſoon as Prince <hi>Eraſtus</hi> was reſtored and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed according to his place and quality, the fame thereof was preſently ſpread through all the City, by means of the great multitude who were aſſembled at the Pallace, to underſtand how the Caſe would be with Prince <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> which having had an honorable iſſue, all the <hi>Romans</hi> both general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, made the greateſt feaſt in the World; in ſuch manner that there was no Man or Woman, young nor old, great nor ſmall, but laid aſide all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, though never ſo importunate; and haſtening to the Pallace endeavoured to ſee the face of the Victorious and Triumphant <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> ſo that no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant entry that was ever made in <hi>Rome,</hi> had cauſed ſo great a croud of people in all the ſtreets, nor no joy more general nor more common; every one ſpeaking ſo highly and advantageouſly as poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could be of Prince <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> who for his part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the people and ſaluted them with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible modeſty; letting them underſtand that he knew how to keep a <hi>medium</hi> without being elevated in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62164:204"/> as his ſpirits had never failed him when he was in adverſity; but it was far otherwiſe with the unhappy <hi>Aphrodicia,</hi> who finding her ſelf in the night time locked up in her Chamber, which thoſe who had the charge of her had provided (they having offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her two Damſels to keep her company, which ſhe reſolving to be alone had refuſed) ſhe began to curſe herſelf, the Heavens and Nature, and being enraged wiſhed that before her death, that it were in her power to ruinate not only her Son in law, but alſo the Emperor himſelf, the Senate, the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Empire, and all the world together; and having a long time continued in theſe wicked meditations, and finding that this would be much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than her former enterprize againſt the life of her Son in Law, ſhe converted all her rage towards her ſelf; and conſidering her ſelf to be culpable not of the crime, which ſhe intended to commit againſt her Husband, but that ſhe enterprized a matter which ſhe could not effect, ſhe attempted to be, revenged on her ſelf, and to dye by her own hands. And not finding any thing to make a cord to ſtrangle her ſelf &amp; much leſs any thing to ſtab her ſelf withal, ſhe then found her ſelf truly miſerable, in that ſhe was neceſſitated to dye of a violent death, and yet had not the means to execute her deſires; this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration brought her into ſo great an Agony that ſhe fell upon the floor in a ſwoon, in which ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time without any knowledge, but in time ſhe recovered, wherefore out of deſpite that ſhe was come to her ſelf, ſhe afreſh curſed ner ſelf and her life, through rage and anger tearing her garment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, in doing whereof ſhe ſaw ſhe had fetched blood on one of her
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62164:204"/> fingers, whereupon ſhe ſearch'd dilligently for that which had cauſed it, to ſee if therewith ſhe might make a larger wound, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reby her Soul might make its iſſue out of her miſerable body: Upon this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſearch ſhe found a bodkin, wherewith ſhe was uſed to prick out figures in parchment to divert her ſelf, and this ſhe had ſtuck into her Clothes as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are uſed to do, without being taken notice of by her Attendants; they having been commanded to take from her every thing that might hurt her, but this bodkin was ſo Cunningly hidden that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be found. Having found this bodkin ſhe took it in her hand, and caſting her ſelf on her bed ſhe ſaid ſee what I am enforc'd to, Ah bodkin! thou haſt ere now when I uſ'd thee, diverted me from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly thoughts, but now thou muſt be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to deliver me from the ſadeſt melancholly that ever any was poſſeſſed with. This bring uttered with a firme reſolution ſhe fixed this bodkin under her left breaſt, and with her finger thruſt it ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it entred up to the top, ſo that having pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her heart it was not long before death ſeized her; yet ſhe lay rather like a ſleeping than a dead woman.</p>
               <p>At the break of day thoſe Lords who had the charge and keeping of her, ſent ſeveral Damſels to ſee how it was with the Empreſs, who opening the Chamber door very ſoftly and ſeeing her lye on the bed thought that ſhe had ſlept, not immagining that it was her laſt long ſleep as indeed it was and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they might not awak her they returned to thoſe that had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent them, telling them that the Empreſs was faſt aſleep; whereupon thoſe Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that had the charge of her were amazed, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:62164:205"/> that one in her condition could ſleep ſo ſoundly. The Sun being riſen they went to the Senate, which on that occaſion was ſo early aſſembled; where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, they adviſed how they ſhould proceed in this affaire, and they concluded that all manner of advantage allowed to Criminals, ſhould be permitted to the Empreſs, that ſhe might Juſtifie her ſelf, that ſhe ſhould have leave to chooſe one or more Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to plead her cauſe, either in her preſence or in her abſence, as ſhe ſhould think fit. This being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Senate, thoſe who had the Empreſs in Cuſtody were ſent to fetch her, that ſhe her ſelf might ſee the fair means they would uſe in her cauſe, notwithſtanding the great rigour and precipitateneſs which ſhe had uſed againſt Prince <hi>Erastus.</hi> The Gentlemen being arrived at the lodging where the Empreſs was deteyned, ſent the ſame Damſels that had been there in the morning to ſee what ſhe did; who finding that ſhe had not ſtirred, carried back word to the Gentlemen that ſhe was not yet awake: Whereupon the Gentlemen wondring reſolved to awake her, and thereupon entring into the Chamber with the Damſels they opened the Windows, and ſeeing that for all that ſhe ſtirred not, one of the Damſels called ſoftly, <hi>Madam, Madam;</hi> To which ſhe not anſwering all who were in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeeing her ſo pale did believe that ſome accident had happened, which was very likely in regard of her great trouble: yet nevertheleſs ſeeing that for ought they could do by throwing water on her face, ſhe came not to her ſelf, they therefore ſent for the Emperours Phyſitians, who being come and having felt her pulſe concluded that ſhe was dead. The
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:62164:205"/> Senate was advertiſed hereof, but none could Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that any trouble of mind though never ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den could have the power to kill, for that griefs though never ſo great, have not the porwer to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs &amp; ſuffocate the vitall ſpirits as an exceſs of joy. And therefore ſearching very dilligently over all the body of the Empreſs to ſee if they could find how ſhe came by her death, they found nothing but a ſcratch which the bodkin had made on her fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which gave little light to the Phyſitians, they Judging it to be impoſſible that ſo little a ſcratch ſhould cauſe her death, in regard they could not find that it was envenomed: In fine one of the Phyſitians obſerving a little blood to be under the Empreſſes left breſt, he put his finger there and feeling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard, he preſſed his finger ſo that he felt the bodkin, which being pluck'd out did plainly ſhew how it had happened. Which being reported to the Emperour, he was at firſt much moved; Yet however being unwilling to hinder the courſe of juſtice, he referred to the Senate to do what they thought fit to the body of the Empreſs; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Felony which ſhe endeavoured to commit to the Emperour, and the Treaſon which ſhe had contrived againſt the life of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Erastus:</hi> But the young Prince who above all things abhorred cruelty and vengance, ſeeing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence fully and entirely juſtified to all the world, which was the only thing he deſired, would in no wiſe permit that any ſhame ſhould be done to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Empreſs, this he eaſily obtained both of the Emperour and Senate to the content of all; ſo that her Funerall was c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lebrated, as belonged to an
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:62164:206"/> Empreſs as may be ſeen by the ſumptuous Tomb that was made for her, which remaineth to this day, where the Emperor cauſed an Epitaph to be ingraved which in few lines contains the whole matter, which is more amply ſpecified in the Hiſtories and Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> whether out of grief or otherwiſe, did not long out live his wife, having firſt elected his Son for his Copartner and ſucceſſor, who being come to the Empire chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his name, governing his eſtates for a time with much prudence, according to the great wiſdom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was endowed, and yet notwitſtanding all his judgement he could not keep himſelf from giving too much credit to the ſpeeches of his malignant wife; although the Plots and contrivances which women had contrived againſt him, ſhould have fore-warned him; but it is very difficult to avoid that which the Heavens have determined, and ſince both the one and the other Hiſtory have ſeemed to me worthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, I have committed them to writing for the profit of poſterity.</p>
               <p>This i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the concluſion of the Hiſtory of the Prince <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and his ſeven wiſe Maſters, as I have tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it from the Originals, <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>french:</hi> but in an old Engliſh book it is very different, as well in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places as I have already recited, as alſo in the concluſion, being the manner of the Empreſſes death, which is thus related.</p>
               <p>The eighth day being come wherein the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be no longer ſilent, but ſpeak in his own defence, and acq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ainting his Keepers with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:62164:206"/> he was carried before the Emperor and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, after due reverence to his Father, and excuſes he gives his reaſons for his ſilence, and for a proof of his innocence of what the Empreſs had charged him with, he chargeth her with incontinence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and the Empreſs and her Damſels being ſent for at the Princes requeſt, one of the ſuppoſed Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels being ſtripped naked before the Court, proves to be a man ſo diſguiſed, with whom the Empreſs was uſed to accompany and often lye, this being a certain proof of the Empreſſes guilt. The Emperor commanded that both ſhe and the Ribauld her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion ſhould be immeadiately burnt: but the Son de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to forbear judgement till ſhe were reproved for her fact. The Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ror then committed the full judgement to his Son, who particularly related how things had paſſed between him and the Empreſs, ſhe ſeeing her wickedneſs diſcovered, fell at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Feet, and crying for mercy, but he wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed her, relating the haniouſneſs of the crimes which ſhe was not able to deny; wherefore the Son demanding juſtice of the Judges and Juſtices, they pronounced this Sentence againſt her, that ſhe ſhould be bound to a horſes tail, and drawn through all the ſtreets of the City, to the place of Execution and there burnt; And that the Ribauld ſhould be quartered and his fleſh caſt to the Hounds, and Birds of the Aire to devoure him, and this was executed upon them.</p>
               <p>This is the Concluſion of the Empreſs as it is related in that former Book, now the Reader having read what both conclude, are left at liberty to believe which they pleaſe; and thus have I given
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:62164:207"/> you a full and particular account of all that I can find Written in any Language, of this Prince <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastus</hi> and thoſe Famous Philoſophers the Seven Wiſe Maſters of <hi>Rome.</hi>
